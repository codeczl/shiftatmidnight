# How to Identify Doppelgangers in Shift at Midnight: A Complete Beginner's Guide

## üéÆ Game Overview

**Shift at Midnight** is a first-person horror co-op game set in a 1990s rural gas station. Players take on the role of midnight shift employees who must identify and eliminate "doppelgangers" ‚Äî ghostly imposters disguised as customers ‚Äî while surviving terrifying encounters.

## üëª What Makes Doppelgangers So Dangerous?

- Some customers are imposters trying to sneak into the store.
- You can ask up to **5 questions** per customer to verify their identity.
- If your judgment is wrong, the doppelganger enters the store and triggers deadly encounters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tips for New Players

### 1. Ask Precision-Based Questions  
Start with questions about **birthdate, address, or ID number** ‚Äî details that imposters often mess up.

### 2. Watch for Behavioral Cues

- **Best hiding spots** include behind the freezer, under counters, or dark storage areas.

## üîÑ Replayability and Random Events

Every run features randomized NPCs, events, and item spawns. After each game, reflect on:

- Was your team coordination smooth and responsive?
