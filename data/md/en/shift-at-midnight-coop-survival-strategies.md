# Hapunan: A Terrifying Dive into Filipino Horror

## What is Hapunan?

**Hapunan** is not just a meal in Filipino culture—it’s a name that now strikes fear into the hearts of gamers. This indie horror game takes players deep into the eerie world of Filipino folklore and urban legends, creating an immersive experience that will leave you breathless. If you think hapunan is just a time for family dinners, think again. This game transforms it into something far more sinister.

## The Story Behind Hapunan

Set in a seemingly quiet Filipino town, **Hapunan** follows the story of a protagonist who finds themselves trapped in a nightmarish version of their own home. As the sun sets and hapunan begins, eerie forces awaken. The player must uncover the secrets hidden in the darkness before they become part of the terrifying legend themselves.

Inspired by Filipino supernatural stories, **Hapunan** masterfully blends traditional beliefs with modern horror elements. The game forces players to question reality as they navigate haunted locations, solve cryptic puzzles, and evade malevolent entities.

## What Makes Hapunan Unique?

Unlike many mainstream horror games, **Hapunan** doesn’t rely solely on jump scares. Instead, it builds tension through atmospheric storytelling, realistic sound design, and deep psychological horror. Here are some of the key features that make **Hapunan** stand out:

### 1. **Filipino Folklore at its Core**
